**Stay hydrated and healthy with gentle reminders!**

This Python project provides a user-friendly tool to remind you to drink water at regular intervals throughout the day, promoting optimal hydration and well-being.

- **Non-intrusive notifications:** Receive gentle notifications delivered through your OS's notification system, ensuring they're timely without being disruptive.
- **Leverages powerful Python libraries:** Built with `plyer` for cross-platform notification support and `time` for accurate scheduling.
- **Open-source and accessible:** Freely available on GitHub for modification and contribution, fostering a collaborative environment.

# Getting Started

Based on Python 3.10 (I hope it would be compatible with newer versions)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Drink_Water_Reminder.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install plyer
   ```
3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   cd Drink_Water_Reminder
   python Drink_Water.py
   ```
4. **(Optional) Set a custom interval:** Modify the `reminder_interval` variable in the script to suit your preferences.

# Customization

The script comes with a default reminder interval, but you can easily adjust it to match your personal hydration goals. Simply locate and modify the `reminder_interval` variable within the script.
